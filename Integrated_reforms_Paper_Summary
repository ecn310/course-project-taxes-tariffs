- How I found this paper: Provided by Professor Ly
- Big picture question: What conditions will allow less developed countries to decrease tariffs, increase consumption tax rate, and improve welfare while government revenue remains constant?
- Hypothesis: Given high tariffs and low consumption taxes, what conditions under which the reduction of tariffs and increases in consumption taxes improve welfare while keeping government revenue constant? 
Take into account that there are well-known relative inefficiencies of tariffs to consumption taxes.

    • How I found this paper: provided by Professor Zhu
    • Big picture question: What are the effects of graduating college in a poor economy
and how long do these negative effects persist?
    • Hypothesis: The economic conditions at the time of college graduation, specifically for
white males, can impact their ability to find work for the first two decades of their
careers.
    • Specific question: When graduating in a poor economy, are graduates more likely
to experience job mismatching and/or experience long-term effects from entering
the labor market during a bad time?
    • Hypothesis: If graduating in a worse-off economy, graduates will be more likely to
experience job mismatching as there are fewer opportunities available and will suffer
higher unemployment rates from the labor market conditions.

Professor Lyn suggested it.
The big question of the paper: reducing tariffs and increasing consumption taxes within an integrated tax structure can enhance welfare in less-developed countries while maintaining government revenue, emphasizing the benefits of moving towards a more uniform tax burden.
Specific research question: Under what conditions can reducing tariffs and increasing consumption taxes improve welfare in less-developed countries while ensuring that government revenue remains constant?
Theories: What conditions allow for the reduction of tariffs and the increase of consumption taxes to enhance welfare in less-developed countries while keeping government revenue stable, particularly, in that achieving uniform tax burdens promotes economic efficiency?
