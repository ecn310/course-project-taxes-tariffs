• How I found this paper: provided by Professor Zhu
• Big picture question: What are the effects of graduating college in a poor economy
and how long do these negative effects persist?
• Hypothesis: The economic conditions at the time of college graduation, specifically for
white males, can impact their ability to find work for the first two decades of their
careers.
• Specific question: When graduating in a poor economy, are graduates more likely
to experience job mismatching and/or experience long-term effects from entering
the labor market during a bad time?
• Hypothesis: If graduating in a worse-off economy, graduates will be more likely to
experience job mismatching as there are fewer opportunities available and will suffer
higher unemployment rates from the labor market conditions.
