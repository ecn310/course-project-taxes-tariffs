# Abstract

We investigate the relationship between consumption taxes such as Value Added Tax (VAT) and
tariffs in developing and developed countries, with the aim of understanding the fiscal strategies
employed by both developing and developed countries. Specifically, we explore whether there
exists an inverse relationship between consumption tax and tariff revenue, hypothesizing that as
consumption taxes like VAT increases, tariff revenue decreases. Utilizing data from the World In-
tegrated Trade Solution (WITS) database, covering 194 countries from 1988 to 2022, we analyze
the two forms of taxation as a percentage of government revenue and consider their implications
for economic development. Our findings reveal a moderate negative correlation between VAT and
tariff revenue in developing and developed countries, with a correlation coefficient of -0.3255,
indicating that as countries shift towards consumption-based taxes like VAT, their reliance on
tariffs decreases. Our research discusses these findings within the context of broader tax reform literature, analyzing the relationship of shifting from trade taxes to consumption taxes.
