# Abstract

We investigate the relationship between consumption taxes such as Value Added Tax (VAT) and
international tax in developing and developed countries, with the aim of understanding the evolv-
ing fiscal strategies employed in response to global economic integration. Specifically, we explore
whether there exists an inverse relationship between consumption tax and tariff revenue, hypoth-
esizing that as consumption taxes like VAT increases, tariff revenue decreases. Additionally, we
used gross domestic product (GDP) in current U.S. dollars to identify what countries are consid-
ered developed and developing. Utilizing data from the World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS)
database, covering 194 countries from 1988 to 2022, we analyze the two forms of taxation as
a percentage of government revenue and consider their implications for economic development.
Our findings reveal a moderate negative correlation between VAT and tariff revenue, with a cor-
relation coefficient of -0.3255, indicating that as countries shift towards consumption-based taxes
like VAT, their reliance on tariffs decreases. This trend is particularly notable in developing coun-
tries, where tariffs historically constituted a larger share of revenue. The paper discusses these
findings within the context of broader tax reform literature, highlighting the potential benefits of
shifting from trade taxes to consumption taxes.
