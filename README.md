# Abstract

We explore the relationship between consumption taxes, such as value added tax (VAT), and tariffs in developed and developing countries to better understand the revenue strategies employed by both groups of countries. Specifically, we explore the correlation between consumption tax and tariffs. We hypothesize that as the share of revenue from consumption taxes increases, the share derived from tariffs decreases, indicating a negative correlation between these two revenue sources.  Using data from the World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS) database, which covers 194 countries from 1988 to 2022, we analyze the two forms of taxation as a percentage of government revenue and consider their implications for economic development. Our findings reveal a moderate negative correlation between consumption tax and tariff revenue in both developing and developed countries, with a correlation coefficient of -0.3255. The implications of this value indicate an inverse relationship between consumption taxes and tariffs in developed and developing countries. Our research synthesizes these findings with the broader literature on tax reform, analyzing why countries opt for tariff revenue or consumption taxes.
