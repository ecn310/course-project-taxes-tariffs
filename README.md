# Taxes and Tarriffs

Our team's goal was to analyze the relationship between taxes and tarriffs in developing and developed countries using GDP Per Capita, Value Added Tax, and International Tax. 

Our working hypothesis is If Value Added Tax increases in a developed or developing country, then tariffs decrease.
Our Null hypothesis is In a developed or developing country, there is no difference in tarrifs when value added tax changes.

Our findings have confirmed our hypothesis and allowed us to reject the null hypothesis with an astounding P-value of 0.000 and a negative correlation of around -0.32. Our do files can be found in the .do folder. Our data we used can be found in the .dta folder. Our original excel sheets can be found in the .excel files folder and our PNG files used in our final report can be found in the .png files folder


Some of our most notable files are sortedultimatemerge.dta which is our humorous name for our final dataset which can be explored and opened in Stata.
