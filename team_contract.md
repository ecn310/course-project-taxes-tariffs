### Team Contract:

__Meeting__: Agreed to meet on Wednesdays at 5:30pm at Bird Library. The exact location will vary depending on the time of day, since after 8 pm the side facing Pages Cafe is closed. As a general rule of thumb, any meetings before 8pm will be at Pages and meetings after 8pm will be planned in the iMessage group chat. 

__Communication__: Communicate through Imessage Group Chat. If you cannot make the meeting, communicate that at least two hours before or buy everyone core life. The two hour deadline is a hard deadline and is not flexible.

__Participation__: Agreed to Split the work as evenly as we can and maximize people's strengths, everyone must submit assignments on time, we will switch off who has to take notes every meeting. Umar will do check ins with Prof Buzard every two weeks. Dylan will check over assignments and be the designated weekly checker.

__Conduct__: Be respectful and be a good person. 

__Conflicts__: Talk it through. If someone submits an assignment late or does not split the work load evenly, then they have to run 24 miles at Barnes.
