GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) doesn't have a built-in automatic table of contents (TOC) generation. However, you can create one manually by linking to section headers in your document using anchor links. Here's how to do it:

1. Create the TOC
Write the table of contents as a list, using [Link Text](#header-id) syntax. The #header-id is automatically generated from the section header text, converted to lowercase, with spaces replaced by hyphens and special characters removed.

2. Add Section Headers
Create the corresponding headers in your markdown file. These should match the links in the TOC.

### Downloading the Data

The data being used for this research project is from World Integrated Trade Solution. We analyzed these three time series datasets
- [Taxes on international trade](https://wits.worldbank.org/CountryProfile/en/Country/BY-COUNTRY/StartYear/1988/EndYear/2022/Indicator/GC-TAX-INTT-RV-ZS)
- [Taxes on Goods and Services](https://wits.worldbank.org/CountryProfile/en/Country/BY-COUNTRY/StartYear/1988/EndYear/2022/Indicator/GC-TAX-GSRV-VA-ZS)
- [GDP per capita](https://wits.worldbank.org/CountryProfile/en/Country/BY-COUNTRY/StartYear/1988/EndYear/2022/Indicator/NY-GDP-PCAP-PP-CD)

To download raw data, use the links above to access the datasets on the WITS website. Then, click the light grey button that has an arrow pointing downwards in the top right of the table.

The datasets for from above can be found in our [raw_data](https://github.com/ecn310/course-project-taxes-tariffs/tree/main/Reproducibility_Package/raw_data) folder. they are labeled:
- internationaldataset.xlsx
- consumptiontaxdataset.xlsx
- GDPdataset.xlsx 

### Datasets

[internationaltax.dta](Reproducibility_Package/Data_Files/internationaltax.dta): Describes the international tax variable by showing how much percent of revenue is generated by tariffs in a given country. 

[consumptiontaxreproducible.dta](Reproducibility_Package/Data_Files/consumptiontaxreproducible.dta): Describes the consumption tax variable by showing how much percent of revenue is generated by consumption tax in a given country. 

[gdpdata.dta](Reproducibility_Package/Data_Files/gdpdata.dta): This dataset contains data on GDP Per Capita for countries in terms of current US dollars (as of 2022) used to sort and organize countries into developing and developed.
