- Professor Ly suggested it.
- **The big question(s) of the paper**:
- 1. Will reducing tariffs  within an integrated tax structure enhance welfare in less-developed countries while maintaining government revenue?
- 2. Will increasing consumption taxes within an integrated tax structure enhance welfare in less-developed countries while maintaining government revenue?
- **Specific research question**: Given high tariffs, low consumption taxes, and the well-known relative inefficienticies of tariffs to consumption taxes, can we identify conditions under which the reduction of tariffs and increase in consumption taxes improve welfare while kepping government revenue constant?
- **Theories**: When tariffs are reduced and consumption taxes increase, governments pay less foreign taxes and more domestic taxes, increasing welfare by driving up demand for substitute products. 
- **Research Hypothesis**: When tariffs are reduced and consumption taxes increase, welfare increases when government revenue remains constant.

-  **How I found this paper**: provided by Professor Ly
-  **Big picture question**: To research the implications of a connection that is widely acknowledged and rarely appreciated by exploring the nexus of tariffs and taxes.
- **Specific research question**: Exploring how tariffs were instruments of advantage because they were the outcome of private benefits pursued to collective detriment.
- **Conceptual Framework**: Firstly, develop a theory of taxation politics and apply it to the tariff. Then, submit the theory to an empirical test. Finally, from the extent of the treasury's dependence upon it and from the distributive pattern of its burdens and benefits, the article can make its conclusion.
- **Research Hypothesis**: "Government Revenue dependence and distributive incidence account for several diverse aspects of American tariff policy, including the structure of its coalitions, the shifts in its objectives, and the timing of its innovations."
- **Theories**: "Analysts grounded in the traditions of American politics credited tariff outcomes to domestic political pressures. On the other half, analysts attributed tariff policy to pursuits of national interest in an anarchic world economy."

-  **How I found this paper**: provided by Professor Ly
-  **Big picture question**: How do low-income countries pivot from trade taxes to domestic consumption taxes? 
- **Specific research question**: How effective are transitions from trade taxes to domestic consumption taxes for low-income countries when its come to revenue?
- **Conceptual Framework**: Used actual data on imported value, tariffs, and up to ten domestic taxes on more than 400,000 import transactions from Nepal to develop scenarios in which tariffs can be cut with the least impact on total revenue. Also used partial equilibrium models to produce estimates that assuage fears about the scale of loss of revenue and production.
- **Research Hypothesis**: If low-income countries properly enforce domestic consumption taxes, then they will better offset reductions in comparison to their use of trade taxes because they will see a positive change in estimated revenue. 
- **Theories**: When low-income countries have higher domestic consumption taxes in relation to trades taxes, they will minimize loss of revenue, since they are reducing expenses by paying less foreign taxes.
