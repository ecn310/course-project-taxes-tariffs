- Data.tex update to reflect new variables and if the variables are nominal or conditional Due: 11/01/2024

We need to work on in the future:

2. Write Results, Discussion sections
3. Write Theory / Hypothesis
4. Finalize Replication Package / Data Appendix
5. Expand and finalize Lit Review, References
6. Finalize Intro and Conclusion
7. Write Abstract

Final submission plan: 

Question for group: is the table needed? I feel like we can add revisions later but most of the tasks are listed here. Please advise otherwise I will not add a table since we do not need it. 

1. 11/01/2024 - Complete Stata do file and reproduciblity package - get feedback and adjust as nessecary - resubmit if nessecary 

2. 11/05/2024 - Complete the first correlation tests - confirm what tests we must carry out and how to do so in Stata 

3. 11/07/2024 - Create a discussion which explains our results and if they confirm our hypothesis 

Items 2 and 3 have a flexible deadline because we may need feedback or may make errors which will require the help of Professor Buzard 

4. 11/07/2024 - Write hypothesis and clear why theory (hard deadline) 

5. 11/14/2024 - Expand and finalize lit review to incorporate 10 sources; it has to be done by this date but we can add sources anytime before this date --> keep Lit review Log updated 

6. 11/21/2024 - Finalize intro and conclusion --> create a intro and conclusion log (they do not need to be seperate) 

7. 11/22/2024 - 12/16/2024 - Write abstract --> create a detailed log for things that need to be completed on the abstract titled "abstract log"
